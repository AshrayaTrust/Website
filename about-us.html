<p class="demi font-xl">Ashraya Trust was established in June 2011 by Avadhoota Nadananda. The Sadh guru has constituted a team to oversee and implement the objectives of Ashraya Trust and the main objective lies in SERVING the NEEDY</p>

<p> Ashraya Trust is based in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh and since the past 8 years, it has been providing drinking water to the thirsty, serving food to those who are hungry, education to the poor students and medicines to the needy. </p>
<p>The key seva activities carried out by the trust are:</p>
<p>
<ul>
	</li> - Kshuda Nivarana</li><br>
	<!-- </li> - Trisha Nivarana</li><br> -->
	</li> - Rugna Nivarana</li><br>
	</li> - Ugadi Seva</li><br>
</ul>
</p>

<h5 class="has-text-align-center text-red demi mb-4">Kshuda Nivarana</h5>
<p>The Kshuda Nivarana program ensures that people are fed with food at government
hospitals, railway stations, bus stops and other places every single day. The beneficiaries
are those who cannot afford their daily bread. Around an estimate of over 1000 food
packets are distributed everyday.</p>
<p>
During Ugadi Yatri Seva All the enroute devotees are served hot, fresh and nutritious food along with buttermilk for 24 hours. Additionally, drinking water, tea, biscuits, snack and fruits to carry through further journey are provided.</p>

<h5 class="has-text-align-center text-red demi mb-4">Rugna Nivarana</h5>
<p>On every Sunday the Trust runs free medical camps at the nearby rural segments and
provides free medicines. It also runs a mobile dispensary.
</p>
<p>During Ugadi Yatri Seva Volunteers are trained by certified doctors on cleaning the wounds and wrapping bandages for all the cuts & wounds on their feet. Special ointments, antiseptic powders etc. are provided for further care.Doctors are available for all the 24 hours in reaching out to the yatris for any of their ailments. There are cases when serious injuries are treated at the camp. Both Homeo and Allopathic medicines are provided at free of cost for these yatris.
</p>

<h5 class="has-text-align-center text-red demi mb-4">AksharaTara  Gurukulam</h5>
<p>The concept of AksharaTara Gurukulam</p>
<p>Mandlem, is a village near Kurnool which is enroute to Srisailam. Asitanga Bhairava Shiva Lingam is installed here who is the Kshetra Palaka. Rudrabhishekam is performed on every Masa Shiva Ratri and lakhs of devotees find solace here receiving medical, food and oil massages during their paada yatra to Srisailam during Ugadi. </p>
<p>To facilitate the saadhaks, 24 cottages are constructed, who would stay, cook and do Saadhana for a particular period. It is at the same place, the divine sankalpam of AksharaTara Gurukulam is rising !!!</p>
<p>In Aksharatara Gurukulam, the aptitude of the child and his / her aspirations & passion are given importance. Learning is made joyous. The life skills which are parmanent to the all round personality development of the child is given a prior importance.</p>
<p>The key points of the Gurukulam are:</p>
<p>1. Integrating the education curriculum with ancient Bharateeya system of education as a residential programme.</p>
<p>2. Education starts at the age of 5 years and graduated at 20th year, i.e., a whole period of 15 years.</p>
<p>3. In these 15 years, first year is only an observation of the child by Gurus who are also resident at the Gurukulam.</p>
<p>4. At the end of the First Year, the minute detailed observation of the child in the free environment enriched with positive vibrations are carried out</p>
<p>5. Customised curriculum is formulated for each child and it is introduced in stages.</p>
<p>6. The 64 Kalas of the ancient Bharateeya system is taught to the children by the time of graduation.</p>
<p>7. The parents of the children are given a clear understanding initially and also at every stage to integrate them into the concept of Gurukulam.</p>

<h5 class="has-text-align-center text-red demi mb-4">Ugadi Yatri Seva</h5>
<p>Ugadi Yatri Seva is an annual seva activity by Ashraya Trust to reach out to the needs of devotees who walk from various parts of Karnataka to Srisailam.</p>
<p>This is, sometimes, a month long walkathon to reach the abode of Shiva at Srisailam by foot. They all generally come in groups for this journey that involves walking miles and they carry bare minimum essentials. They walk with cut wounds, oozing blood & puss, swelling in their legs, aching bodies and hunger driving them nuts. None of this stops them from walking towards their destination. They get to pass through a particular route a week before Ugadi (Telugu & Kannada New Year day). It generally falls in the last weeks of March to first few weeks of April. Ashraya Trust treats this as an opportunity to serve these divine souls in various ways. While the preparation for the seva begins as early as two months in advance, it gets divided into various wings.</p>


<p class="text-red demi font-xl">1. Oil Massage</p>
<p>Oil Massage to male and female devotees in separate sheds by respective male and female volunteers.</p>
<p>The oil used for this massage is specially prepared by Guruji on a specific day  with specific nakshatra at Brahma muhurtha in a siddha medicine formula as  received from their ancestors. There are many miracle stories for the past 8  years of how it helped the devotees get relieved of their pain and helped them  gain energy post the massage.</p>
<p class="text-red demi font-xl">2. Food Counter</p>
<p>All the enroute devotees are served hot, fresh and nutritious food along with  buttermilk for 24 hours. Additionally, drinking water, tea, biscuits, snack and  fruits to carry through further journey are provided.</p>

<p class="text-red demi font-xl">3. Wound Cleaning</p>
<p>Volunteers are trained by certified doctors on cleaning the wounds and wrapping  bandages for all the cuts &amp; wounds on their feet. Special ointments,  antiseptic powders etc. are provided for further care.</p>
<p class="text-red demi font-xl">4. Medical Wing</p>
<p>Doctors  are available for all the 24 hours in reaching out to the yatris for any of  their ailments. There are cases when serious injuries are treated at the camp.  Both Homeo and Allopathic medicines are provided at free of cost for these  yatris.</p>
<p>Volunteers are provided accommodation at the camp  premises with food and basic amenities.</p>
<p class="text-red demi font-xl">Points to be noted:</p>
<p>Neither are  we doing any seva nor are we gaining any other results. What we are doing is  Pooja to the walking Shivas. They walk thousands of kilometres from different  parts of South India to reach the eternal abode of Shiva at Srisailam, known as  second Jyotirlinga.</p>
<p>The concept  of Seva to walking Shivas is to connect with the eternal Shiva When we wash  their feet, it is with Ganapati Bhaavam (as a son pouring water to his father's  tired feet after a long walk to put him at ease) Oil massage and  pressing leg is with Paravati Bhaavam (as a wife presses the legs of her  husband when he comes tired after a long walk).Feeding is  Annapoorna  Bhaavam (as a hungry Shiva  standing at the doorstep of Annapoorna just as a mother feeds a tired child.). All other sevas  in Sishya Bhaavam because they are the Shivas in Dakshina Murthy Bhaava.</p>

<p class="text-white">He never teaches or preaches any tradition, any philosophy and he see that the devotees and team around him experiencing oneness with ultimate reality by serving others. Devotees experience the body, the mind, the intellect complexes vanish during the service of one or two hour everyday. Oneness of consciousness to cosmic consciousness was there, is here and would be there.</p>

<p class="text-white">Never you find a richman moves around him with bundles of notes for his needs. One can witness common man is around him who shares few bucks from their hardly saved money. For Seva he never begs and he never begs for his food. He says ” Everything is destined and it comes in time. Thus money flows for projects and they are happy and all are happy.</p>

<p class="text-white">Assume, who is He? That visionary and missionary is non other than our Guruji i.e, Avadhoota Nadananda..</p>

	<p>Renouncing behind everything from a remote village of Kerala, he traveled and did penance in Himalayan forest and was in search of the truth of existence.</p>
	<p>Then he realized the sadhana and its accumulated energy must be utilised for the upliftment of depressed, deprived, humilitated, tormented, tortured suffering people around us is the real penance. On the banks of Ganga, Narmada, in cities, pilgrim centres he walked around as a parivrajaka to experience their life.<br>
	“Rich people are begging inside abode of Almighty and Poor people are begging for a morsel of food infront abode of Almighty”. This is what he experienced.
<br>
He found a Mission, renunciation is not the only a way to realize, service to humanity is also a path. Again he moved around entire India and created teams who understands his philosophy- ‘ Service to mankind is service to God’. He is visible in streets, in slums, among the leprocy patients, in hospital wards, on footpaths, in bus stands, feeding the suffering people and arranging medical camps and teaching small children and clothing them. May be it in Dhar, in Kurnool, in Bangalore , in Visakapatnam surrounded with likeminded devotees who take a vow to serve the needy.</p>
